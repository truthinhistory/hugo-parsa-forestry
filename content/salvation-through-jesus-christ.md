**Salvation through Jesus Christ**

“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:" (John 1:12)

**The Words of Our Lord Jesus to Us for Our Salvation**

“Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.” John 3:3-7

**All are Sinners - We cannot Save Ourselves**  
  
“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;” (Romans 3:23)

“As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:” (Romans 3:10)

**God's Remedy for Sin**

“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:" (John 1:12)

**All May be Saved Now**

“Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him,” (Rev. 3:20a)

“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

(Romans 10:13)

**The Assurance**  
“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.” (I John 5:13)

**God Loves You**  
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16)

* A*. ACKNOWLEGE THAT YOU ARE A SINNER

  “And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.” (Luke 18:13)
* B*. BELIEVE

  “And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.” ( Acts 16:31)
* C*. CONFESS

  “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. ( Romans 10:9-10)

**Repent**

“Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost” (Acts 2:38)
