“He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.”

\-- PROVERBS 18:13

“The man who will not investigate both sides of a question is dishonest.”

\-- ABRAHAM LINCOLN

“Once people are trained in a particular theory, they become emotionally wedded to it. They can be literally incapable of seeing anything that contradicts it, and will invent the most amazing rationalizations. That’s why you have to wait for a generation to die off before you can move on.”

\--J.P. HOGAN

“He that is flexible shall not be bent out of shape”

\--A WISE MAN

“A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels”

\--PROVERBS 1:5
